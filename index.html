		<h3>Delete Files Automator Action</h3>

			<p>
				Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/apps/all.html#automator">Automator</a> is a handy application for basic OSX
			automation. One thing it doesn't ship with, however, is the ability to delete files. It can move items to the trash, but it can't
			empty the trash without a little help. <b>Delete Files.action</b> makes file deletion possible, and provides the following:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					Standard (delete-only) and secure deletion.
				</li>
				<li>
					Recursive deletion.
				</li>
				<li>
					The ability to delete files only, while leaving directory structures in place.
				</li>
				<li>
					Force deletion of read-only files.
				</li>
				<li>
					Optional confirmation prompting, with custom confirmation text.
				</li>
				<li>
					Some example workflows to get you started.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				I first released this back in September of 2005; the current version is the same as what was released then, but should play more nicely
				with modern OSX installs.  If you have any trouble with it, please contact me.

				for UITextFields and UITextViews which provides serial navigation functionality similar to that which Safari provides when
