		<h3>Delete Files Automator Action</h3>

			<p>
				Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/apps/all.html#automator">Automator</a> is a handy application for basic OSX
			automation. One thing it doesn't ship with, however, is the ability to delete files. It can move items to the trash, but it can't
			empty the trash without a little help. <b>Delete Files.action</b> makes file deletion possible, and provides the following:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					Standard (delete-only) and secure deletion.
				</li>
				<li>
					Recursive deletion.
				</li>
				<li>
					The ability to delete files only, while leaving directory structures in place.
				</li>
				<li>
					Force deletion of read-only files.
				</li>
				<li>
					Optional confirmation prompting, with custom confirmation text.
				</li>
				<li>
					Some example workflows to get you started.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				I first released this back in September of 2005; the current version is the same as what was released then, but should play more nicely
				with modern OSX installs.  If you have any trouble with it, please contact me.

				<a href="https://github.com/jrmiddle/JMPrevNextAccessoryView">JMPrevNextAccessoryView</a> is a simple inputAccessoryView
				for UITextFields and UITextViews which provides serial navigation functionality similar to that which Safari provides when
				navigating form elements. It's easy to integrate, flexible, and its appearance is customizable for each associated field.

				Various shims and jigs I've created while writing objective-c code, which don't merit their own distros.  Mostly (actually, currently only)
				categories, including:
				<ul>
					<li>
						NSArray+ArrayUtils: Category on NSArray which provides static and instance methods which, similar to Python list comprehensions,
						allow one array to be transformed into another, with a function (block) applied to each element in turn.
					</li>
					<li>
						NSArray+StringUtils: Category on NSString with the following methods:
						<dl>
							<dt><code>- (BOOL) hasSubString:</code></dt>
							<dd>Check whether <code>subString</code> is contained within an NSString instance.</dd>
							
							<dt><code>- (BOOL) startsWithDigit</code></dt>
							<dd>Hopefully, self explanatory.</dd>
							
							<dt><code>+ (NSString *) stringByJoiningArray:withDelimiterString:;</code></dt>
							<dd>Easily create an NSString by joining the string representations of elements of an NSArray. Yes, you could argue
								that this should be a category on NSArray instead. Go for it.</dd>
							
							<dt><code>+ (NSString *) stringByJoiningDict:withKeyValueDelimiterString:withPairDelimiterString:</code></dt>
							<dd>Similar to <code>+stringByJoiningArray:withDelimiterString:</code>, this makes it easy to join the key/value pairs of a dictionary
								into a string.</dd>
							
							<dt><code>+ (NSString*)md5HexDigestString:</code></dt>
							<dd>Static factory method to create an MD5 digest of the given NSString.</dd>
							
							<dt><code>- (NSString *)md5HexDigest</code></dt>
							<dd>Instance method on NSString to create an MD5 digest.</dd>
						</dl>
					</li>
				</ul>
